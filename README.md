# Abstract

This undergraduate thesis aims at the construction, modeling, and control of a prototype of an inverted pendulum. Initially, a theoretical study on the subject was conducted, covering classical mechanics concepts, electromechanical systems control, and mathematical modeling of physical systems. Next, the prototype construction was carried out, consisting of a structure supporting an inverted pendulum. The system comprises a direct current motor, an optical encoder, and a microcontroller that receives encoder data and controls the motor. The mathematical modeling of the system was performed based on Newton's laws and the equations of motion for the inverted pendulum. Transfer functions were obtained to relate the input (voltage applied to the motor) to the output (pendulum position). Finally, the design and implementation of a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller for the system were carried out, aiming to stabilize the pendulum in the vertical position. Experimental tests were conducted to verify the efficiency of the controller. The results demonstrated that the constructed prototype and implemented controller were capable of maintaining the inverted pendulum in the vertical position, showing the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.
